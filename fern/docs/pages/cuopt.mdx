---

NVIDIA cuOpt is a **GPU-accelerated optimization engine** designed to solve complex routing and decision-making problems at massive scale.

It leverages NVIDIA CUDA to dramatically accelerate combinatorial optimization workloads that traditionally run slowly on CPUs.

cuOpt is built for real-time and large-scale operational optimization.

---

## What Problems Does cuOpt Solve?

cuOpt focuses on:

- Vehicle routing problems (VRP)
- Dynamic fleet management
- Resource allocation
- Scheduling optimization
- Last-mile delivery optimization
- Constraint-based decision systems

These are computationally intensive problems with exponential complexity. cuOpt uses parallel GPU computation to evaluate many solution candidates simultaneously.

## Why GPU Acceleration Matters

Traditional optimization solvers:

- Run sequentially on CPUs
- Struggle with large datasets
- Have long solve times

cuOpt:

- Uses thousands of GPU cores
- Evaluates solution spaces in parallel
- Produces near-real-time optimization results
- Scales efficiently with larger datasets

This makes it ideal for logistics, robotics fleets, and real-time planning systems.

## Core Capabilities

### High-Performance Route Optimization

Supports:

- Time windows
- Capacity constraints
- Distance constraints
- Multi-vehicle routing
- Dynamic job insertion

---

### Real-Time Re-Optimization

cuOpt can:

- Adapt to changing traffic conditions
- Handle last-minute job updates
- Recalculate routes instantly
- Support streaming input workloads

---

### Constraint Handling

cuOpt supports complex constraints such as:

- Service-level agreements (SLAs)
- Driver shifts
- Vehicle compatibility
- Location restrictions

---

## How cuOpt Works

1. Input problem data (locations, vehicles, constraints)
2. Encode optimization model
3. Transfer data to GPU memory
4. Execute parallel optimization kernels
5. Return optimized routes or schedules

Under the hood, cuOpt uses CUDA-accelerated heuristics and parallel search strategies to explore solution spaces efficiently.

## Example Use Case: Fleet Optimization

A logistics company with:

- 5,000 delivery stops
- 500 vehicles
- Strict time windows

Using cuOpt:

- Routes are generated in seconds instead of minutes
- Real-time updates adjust routes dynamically
- Fuel costs and travel time are minimized
- SLA compliance improves

---

## Integration Scenarios

cuOpt integrates with:

- Omniverse digital twins for simulation testing
- AI systems for demand forecasting
- Cloud GPU instances for scalable optimization
- Enterprise logistics systems via APIs

Example workflow:

1. Forecast demand using AI model  
2. Send route optimization request to cuOpt API  
3. Validate routes in Omniverse simulation  
4. Deploy routes to real-world fleet

## Who Should Use cuOpt?

- Logistics platform engineers  
- Robotics fleet operators  
- Supply chain architects  
- Smart city planners  
- Operations research teams  

cuOpt is ideal when optimization must be:

- Fast  
- Scalable  
- Adaptive  
- GPU-accelerated
