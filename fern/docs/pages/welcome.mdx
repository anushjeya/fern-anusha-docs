The NVIDIA ecosystem provides a **comprehensive set of technologies** for GPU computing, real-time simulation, AI/ML acceleration, and end-to-end workflows.  

It consists of four major areas:

1. **CUDA** – Parallel computing platform for high-performance GPU workloads  
2. **Omniverse** – Real-time simulation and collaborative 3D environment  
3. **AI/ML Acceleration** – Libraries and tools for deep learning and data science  
4. **Integration & Ecosystem** – How all components work together for advanced applications  

> This overview is ideal for developers, engineers, and researchers looking to **harness NVIDIA GPUs** for simulation, optimization, and AI-driven workflows.
